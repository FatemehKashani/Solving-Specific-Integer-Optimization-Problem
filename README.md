# Solving-Specific-Integer-Optimization-Problem
In this repository, we solved a specific problem in the field of integer optimization. The details of the problem are as follows:

**1-** Ten different integers (F1 to F10) in order from small to large:

Conditions of F1 to F10:
- All Fs are multiples of 500.
- None of the Fs is divisible by the other.

**2-** Integer X 

Conditions of X:
- X is divisible by all Fs. 
- X is less than or equal to 1.2 million.
- The following relation is established:

**3-** Conditions of I:
- Choose from the following numbers: [4 millions, 8 millions, 10 millions, 16 millions, 20 millions, 24 millions, 25 millions]

**4-** Conditions of M:
- An integer from 2 to 63

**5-** Conditions of N:
- An integer from 50 to 432

**6-** Conditions of P:
- Choose from the following numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8]

**Note:** The answer is better if X is higher and the difference between F1 and F10 is less.
